        <h1>Sweet California Fried Fingers</h1>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>These fingers are succulent, crunchy, and about as close the real thing as you can get without violating the laws of this new land in which we must hide our true faces and learn to call home.</p>
        <p>A perfect combination of sweetness, salt, and petroleum! These fingers make an easy and delicious meal to prepare on any day of the week.</p>
        <h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Several sticks of a softer wood, like pine or fir</li>
            <li>half a dozen rotten eggs</li>
            <li>1 quart spoiled milk</li>
            <li>1/4 pound maggot-infested cornmeal</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, and strychnine to taste </li>
            <li>Pot of boar's fat</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil sticks in a covered cauldron, between 5-6 hours, depending on wood intergrity. Do not overboil! You should be able to sink your teeth into the outside like flesh, but be sure the inside keeps a crunch like bone.</li>
            <li>Combine milk, eggs, cornmeal (be sure not lose any tasty maggots! They're slippery little buggers), and seasonings to make the batter</li>
            <li>Heat boar's fat to a boil.</li>
            <li>Roll boiled sticks in batter and dunk into boiling fat. This is a fun activity for the whole family! Little ones love dunking their hands in the boiling oil, and snatching the fingers from the pot keeps their prey instincts sharp in the absence of a true hunt</li>
            <li>Cook fingers until golden brown. Serve with ketchup or horse blood!</li>
        </ol>
