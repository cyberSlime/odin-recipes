        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>A wonderful green stew with all the best qualities of pond scum, or the algea you skim off the top of a swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Perfect for when you want a taste of home, but don't have time to make the journey to the hot steamy underbed of our blessed makers, cursed are we to live as surface beings. Pairs well with shrimp, scallops, and isopods!</p>
        <h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 diced toad</li>
            <li> Lightly braised algea</li>
            <li>Gasoline (unleaded is best, but motor oil will work in a pinch!) </li>
            <li>Pinch of grasshopper thighs </li>
            <li> Stewed lilypad</li>
            <li> 1 pound rotten lily flower</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all ingredients except for toad into your standard cast iron caldron</li>
            <li>Simmer over coals for around 8 hours, longer if your lily flower is still crisp. This part will get a nice smell permeating through your house!</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and mix in toad, (to ensure it stays as raw and froggy as possible)</li>
            <li>Serve cold or lukewarm. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
