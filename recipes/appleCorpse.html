        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>The perfect interactive meal to get the kids out of the house for a few hours!</p>
        <p>A true corpse is an unaffordable treat for most of us, but with this dish, you'll forget you're not home in the motherland, that deep chasm in the belly of the earth, standing over your kill, blood running down your chin, ready to feel it's life sustain your own abiding by the natural order which you will one day succumb to as all things should</p>
        <p>This concoction is the next best thing!</p>
        <h4><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h4>
        <ul>
           <li>Rotting apples roughly the weight of an adult human</li>
           <li>1 small dead pig</li>
           <li>Grounding rod on patch of bare earth to attract a lighting strike (I find this makes a great subsitute for the pure sensation of consuming a living soul. It also adds a kick of spice!) </li> 
           <li>Human teeth</li>
           <li>Several handfuls of shelled snails</li>
           <li>Barbeque sauce (for plating) </li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Assemble ingredients and dig a hole in you selected path of earth. I find on the top of a nice bluff works nicely</li>
            <li>Stuff pig corpse with apples, snails, and add the teeth near the snout</li>
            <li>Bury the corpse beneath the lightning rod, and wait. Several months or until next lighting storm is a good rule of thumb. The corpse tastes more authentic with age</li>
            <li>Have the little ones dig it up! There's nothing like a whole family hunt on a dark a stormy night, in which one can almost make believe the glinting eyes in the darkness are those we left behind to come to this new plane of reality, and we sing the old songs and choose to hear the creaks underfoot, as their voices joining our own as we sing to the blessed old moon <em>Granatadia Smshwiqhiihida!</em> </li>
            <li>Serve with barbeque sauce and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
